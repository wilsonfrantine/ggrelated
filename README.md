A set of functions to plot genetic relatedness estimators

---

## 📜 Description

`ggrelated` is a lightweight and straightforward R script designed to plot genetic relatedness estimators, providing visual insights into kinship patterns using data from genetic analyses.

This repository contains the code used to generate the graphs featured in **Frantine-Silva et al. (2022)**, which illustrate patterns of polygynandry and high genetic diversity in *Pimelodus maculatus* ichthyoplankton through kinship analysis and population genetics.

The script takes input files compatible with the **Colony** software and leverages the `related` package (**Pew et al. 2015**) to compute genetic relatedness metrics and produce high-quality visualizations with `ggplot2`.

## 📊 Key Features

- 📈 Generate pairwise and pedigree-relatedness plots directly from Colony output files
- 🧩 Seamless integration with the `related` R package
- 🎨 Customizable plots using `ggplot2`
- 🔬 Ideal for studies in population genetics, kinship analysis, and reproductive biology

## 📷 Preview

Example plots and visualizations will be available by the end of Q2 2025 to showcase the output generated by `ggrelated`! In the meantime, a placeholder example has been added to provide a glimpse of the expected results.

Stay tuned! 🚀
